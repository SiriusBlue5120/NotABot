Awww... :two_hearts: 
@
I love you too :sparkling_heart: 
@
The rose is red, the violet's blue,
The honey's sweet, and so are you. :honey_pot:
Thou are my love and I am thine;
I drew thee to my Valentine: :rose:
The lot was cast and then I drew,
And Fortune said it shou'd be you :revolving_hearts: 
@
Intoxicating your kiss
Intoxicating your lips :notes: 
Nobody does it like this
I find it hard to resist, oh-ooh :notes: 
Feeling out of control, beautifully sold
What's coming over me? :sparkling_heart: 
It's a total eclipse of rationality

The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion; :hugging:
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle.
Why not I with thine? :heart:

Love starts as a feeling, :ribbon:
But to continue is a choice; 
And I find myself choosing you
More and more every day. :heartpulse:
